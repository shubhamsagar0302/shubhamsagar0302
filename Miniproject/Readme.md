Purpose

The primary motivation behind composing this coursework is to build up a program in python, utilizing loop concept as well as file read and write for the given scenario of an electronic store. It ought to likewise module algorithm, pseudocode, flowchart and data structure of the program.

Aim and objectives

The fundamental focus of this coursework is to take in the idea of programming in python and can compose a program for the given command. Similarly, another target of this coursework is learning the concept of file read and write in python programming language and know almost data structure in python. To achieve this aim will be made to finish all the work in the given time frame. Additionally, more research and study relating with this errand will be made.

Scope of the project

This undertaking outlines the thoughts and techniques for composing programs in pythons utilizing loop concept. It additionally comprises algorithm, pseudocode, flowchart and data structure of the program. therefore, this undertaking will be extremely useful for every one of those understudies, programmer, software engineers and python learner students to discover how the code execute and work in the program. Similarly, It will instruct the strategy of different data structure which has been utilized as a part of the program. At last, as the program is composed with great clarification in each progression so it will help every one of those students who discover trouble in python.
